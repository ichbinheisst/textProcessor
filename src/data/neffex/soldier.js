  script: `I spit raps like a heart attack
    Fast fatal hard impact
    Past painful scars infact
    I blast tasteful bars in packs
    
    I back up my actions fact
    Don't ask grab reactions jacked
    Attack with every word then act
    With class as they hear me snap
    
    I got nothing to lose
    Cause I fought and felt the bruise
    Now I'm not the one confused
    Call the shots and they produce
    
    I ain't lost I'm finally loose
    Pick a noose over excuse
    I need the views to boost me to
    A new abuse of being used
    
    Everybody wants a piece now
    Y'all can rest in piece now
    Your dead to me so peace out
    Remember your discrete doubt
    
    Get ready for defeat now
    I'm gon make you bleed out
    Listen on repeat now
    And weed out all the weak now
    
    Get up and make a change
    Don't remember yesterday
    If you got something to say
    Speak your mind before your grave
    Cause your life is yours to save
    Ain't nobody gonna change
    Everybody stays the same
    So be different make a name huh?
    
    And just like a soldier
    Keep on moving forward
    Always getting closer
    March until it's over

    It's ridiculous I'm spitting this
    Meticulous and limitless
    While others out there spittin shit
    Got hits up on the charts that sit
    
    I see why other artists quit
    Cause people don't reward good shit
    They love to hate but hate to live
    Society you swing and miss
    
    And honestly I get it
    Promise me you won't regret it
    Wasting energy forget it
    Don't look back go on get it
    
    Bite the bullet just a bit
    Bite your tounge and don't say shit
    Make your actions hard to miss
    Be a legend not a myth
    
    It's obnoxious
    That I'm conscious
    Rappin honest
    As promised
    Try to harness
    As an artist
    Stay modest
    It's a long quest
    I will not quit
    Till ten thousand people going off when I drop this
    
    I gotta make it now
    Swear to God I'm breaking out
    Swear to God I'll take a bow
    Center stage with a crowd
    Cause I got it figured out
    I'm just honest and I'm loud
    Staying modest but I'm proud
    No I never had doubt yea
