  script: `Deep down, I know I'm a fighter
    Deep down, I know my desires
    Everybody thinks that I'm just a liar
    They don't know what I got inside, yeah
    I'm no one to fight fire with fire
    I'm the type who never let's me get tired
    Mess with me, and they never will find ya, yeah
    
    People tell me I won't get it
    They don't know me 'cause I'm cold winning
    Always in the ninth, our closin' is
    Always in my mind, oh, no quittin'
    I'ma be the one that blows up in it
    You can be the one that shows up missing
    I'ma be the one that knows my mission
    You gon' be the one with no ambition
    
    I'ma make you take it, take it, take it all back
    You ain't never gonna get me, man, I'm too fast
    Call me the juice, that fourty of dash
    Always look forward, no, never look back
    I just spit the truth, better listen to my best
    Give me up in a booth and I put 'em on a blast
    When I spit the truth, they gon' listen to the wrath
    Gonna never lose, so I put up in the bed
    That's what I do, hard work, always last
    And my pain's not a neck, though it hurts real bad
    But you have to attack what you want to attract
    Or you gonna look back and regret what you lack, uh
    Everybody knows, it's a fact, yeah
    I just want my words to impact, yeah
    I just want my words to [?], yeah
    I'm not sorry if I put you on blast, uh
    
    They know just what they see on the outside
    They don't know just what I'm like on the inside
    If you knew what I could do, you'd watch your backside
    If you knew what I could do, you'd stay in at night
    I'm the type of dude you don't wanna fuck with
    I'm the type of dude, enough is enough, bitch
    I'm the type of dude who never gets completion
    I'm the type of dude who knows he's gonna make it, I'll make it
    
    Yeah, let's go
    
    Can't escape from my thoughts, like a black hole
    Can't escape from these thoughts and these assholes
    Too many people feeling entitled
    Too many people stay in idle
    Man, I work every day for the title
    And I'ma get it, that thought is final
    The way I think, you could say it's primal
    Kill or be killed, I'm your rival
    
    And I don't lose, no
    I'ma be the one they choose though
    You could be the one they'd lose, ho
    Way too busy in snooze, bro
    I'ma be the one to rise up in it
    Never gonna fall, I fight till I get it
    Always stand tall, got pride, I'm grinning
    I don't really think I'll ever find my limit
    
    And I know that they all wanna hate me
    But they see me on a cloud, so they wait, see
    If I make it then they just might say, b
    You can do, it's all good, brother, [?]
    I don't wanna hear your words or the fake shit
    Nah, I want my day one and you be patient
    All the sane people never be complacent
    We were working hard, man, we're on the same shit
    I'm not just a sinner, I eat you for dinner
    I'm not a beginner, I'll paint you a picture
    I got a guitar and I played that shit every day
    No, I was not that great, figured I'd had a place
    Learned out of chance to be learned out of weapons
    Sain' passion is everything but they do [?]
    Ten thousand hours so I could be fucking king
    Hand me the crown and just get out my fucking ring
    
    They know just what they see on the outside
    They don't know just what I'm like on the inside
    If you knew what I could do, you'd watch your backside
    If you knew what I could do, you'd stay in at night
    I'm the type of dude you don't wanna fuck with
    I'm the type of dude, enough is enough, bitch
    I'm the type of dude who never gets completion
    I'm the type of dude who knows he's gonna make it, I'll make it`,
