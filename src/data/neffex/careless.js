    And how careless we could be
    
    Yeah
    All day
    And all night
    We'd stay up
    It felt so right
    We were so young
    We were so dumb
    We would get drunk
    And then hook up
    We were ok
    We were alright
    Staying awake
    Till the sun rise
    We were in love
    Couldn't stop us
    Like a good drug
    Never enough
    
    We'd hook up in my car
    Drive it so far
    Play you guitar
    You'd show me your art
    Let down our guards
    Think with our hearts
    Stare at the stars
    We were never apart
    Drinking to young
    Way too much fun
    Out in the sun
    Or in when it's gone
    Took you to prom
    Dance to our song
    Dance all night long
    Till the lights come on
    
    But it's too late now I remember everything
    And how careless we could be
    But it's too late now I remember you and me
    And how careless we could be
    
    It's too late now I remember everything
    And how careless we could be
    And how careless we could be
    And how careless we could be
    
    And how careless we could be
    And how careless we could be
    
    Late nights
    Long fights
    It felt right
    We were alive
    We would go out
    We were so loud
    We were so proud
    We had no doubts
    Week ends
    And week days
    We'd spend
    Our own way
    We were careless
    We were fearless
    We were reckless
    Time was precious
    
    We loved to waste time
    Whiskey and wine
    Drinking all night
    Asleep by your side
    Finally alive
    We would just drive
    Never arrive
    Our journey was life
    Staying out late
    Testing our faith
    Running away
    We lived for today
    Young and so bold
    Never get old
    Screw what we're told
    We can't be controlled
    
    But it's too late now I remember everything
    And how careless we could be
    But it's too late now I remember you and me
    And how careless we could be
    
    It's too late now I remember everything
    And how careless we could be
    And how careless we could be
    And how careless we could be
    
    And how careless we could be
    And how careless we could be
    And how careless we could be
    
    But it's too late now I remember you and me
    And how careless we could be
    `,
