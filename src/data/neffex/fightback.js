  script: `You're never gonna make it
You're not good enough
There's a million other people with the same stuff
You really think you're different
Man you must be kidding
Think you're gonna hit it
But you just don't get it
It's impossible
It's not probable
You're irresponsible
Too many obstacles
You gotta stop it yo
You gotta take it slow
You can't be a pro
Don't waste your time no more

Who the fuck are you
To tell me what to do
I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove
I'm gonna make my move
I'm gonna make it soon
And I'll do it cause it's what I want to fuckin' do

Cause all these opinions
And all these positions
They coming in millions
They're blocking your vision
But no you can't listen
That shit is all fiction
Cause you hold the power 
As long as you're driven

You're never gonna make it
There's no way that you make it
Yeah maybe you can fake it
But you're never gonna make it

Are you just gonna take that?
Make them take it all back
Don't tell me you believe that
Are you just gonna take that
Or will you fucking fight back?

Or will you fucking fight back?

You ain't gonna make it
You ain't never ever gonna break it
You can never beat 'em man they're better than you face it
Thinkin' that they give a damn you're not thinking straight kid
No they don't give a damn you got what I'm saying
I'm not fucking playing
I'll give it to you straight man
There's too many others and you're not that great man
Stop what you're saying
Stop what you're making
Everybody here knows that you're just faking

Nah I don't wanna hear it anymore
I don't wanna hear it anymore
All these fuckin' thoughts they are not what I need anymore
I'm about to shut the mother fucking door
On all you poor ass haters with your heads in the clouds
Talkin' out loud so proud
You better shut your God damn mouths
Before I do more than speak out
Its about to head south

You're never gonna make it
There's no way that you make it
Yeah maybe you can fake it
But you're never gonna make it

Are you just gonna take that?
Make them take it all back
Don't tell me you believe that
Are you just gonna take that
Or will you fucking fight back?

Or will you fucking fight back?`,
