    I'm alone I'm alright
    
    Everybody knows that I'm breaking down
    Everybody knows I ain't faking now
    Everybody knows my hearts vacant now
    Yea she hates me now I made mistakes but now
    I don't ever wanna be alone
    I don't really ever feel at home
    On my own
    In the zone
    That's the only way I know feeling low bought to blow back up! Here I go!
    
    I won't ever let the doubt creep in
    Gotta pop a couple more aspirin
    I don't think I'll ever let you in
    Easier to break it off as friends
    I don't really understand myself
    I don't really understand need help
    I don't wanna be left on the shelf
    Couldn't even hear me if I yelled
    
    It's so cold outside
    I'm alone I'm alright
    It's so cold outside
    I'm alone I'm alright
    It's so cold outside
    I'm alone I'm alright
    It's so cold outside
    I'm alone I'm alright
    It's so cold outside
    I'm alone I'm alright
    It's so cold outside
    I'm alone I'm alright
    
    Yeah,
    Let's go!
    
    I don't wanna break down
    Always feel like I could break now
    But I never let it take me to that place now
    I won't ever let my thoughts get away now
    I got better things to do picking fate now
    I just wanna be the best call me great now
    I don't know if I'm ok or insane now
    I remember better days on the playground
    Hoping I can find my way to a better place now
    
    Even when I'm feeling down I fight
    Even when I don't know what is right
    I'ma pick a side and I'ma take pride
    I will decide my fate and I
    Will never let them tell me who I am
    If you try to shape me I'll be damned
    Planted on the ground is where I stand
    Never give up that was always the plan
    
    It's so cold outside
    I'm alone I'm alright
    It's so cold outside
    I'm alone I'm alright
    It's so cold outside
    I'm alone I'm alright
    It's so cold outside
    I'm alone I'm alright
    It's so cold outside
    I'm alone I'm alright
    It's so cold outside
    I'm alone I'm alright
